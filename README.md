# Uncle Dave was a prepper!

Days ago a strange package from Uncle Dave arrived, it included a map and keys, but the note was cryptic and a bit confusing, but it's all starting to make sense now. It seems that Uncle Dave knew something was up and left some things for you (and hopefully there's tacos!).

Or grab the 10 years later mod and set out to find more food and fuel.

This mod provides a safehouse with water, power, and supplies. Use the options to set or exclude the various types, start with a map, or start in the safehouse.

Each safehouse is fully plumbed and powered. Keep your generator in good condition and enjoy your creature comforts like working washing machines and flushing toilets (until the tanks run dry at least). Every safehouse has a pump, if the generator is running, it will gradually refill the tank over time. Many safehouses have wells or spring water. Recent updates should allow you to move and re-plumb fixtures within a reasonable radius of the original safehouse so you can access the safehouse's water tank.

Uncle Dave was quite a collector and you might find a complete seed library (mods that use seed in their item names should be included). He was well known for being quite a reader, so perhaps he'll have left his complete collection of skill books and magazines too (works with [Gyde's Trait Magazines](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3342191739) and probably other mods that add anything to the skill category).

## About Loot
* Each location varies a bit, but will include a "essentials" storage with some commonly needed items.
* You can turn on all the locations and all the loot but this may make your game lag the first time you get near a safehouse
* I had some trouble fitting in the skill books and if you have a bunch of mods you'll find your shelves very full ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Recently I reworked some of the gun spawning. For most storages the lists work the same, pulling from the game's distribution lists, but I've added a "gun locker" for some spots. Instead of using the normal random distribution, it will build from a list ensuring some standard contents and a variable amount of ammo for the specific gun. At times the random spawn was giving me 10 guns and none of the clips for those guns at all. Lockers are also customized to have specific builds for the base game, but also if you use the [Vanilla Firearms Expansion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3434049989) or [Rain's Firearms & Gun Parts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3387222454) mods, you will find lockers built specifically for these mods. The guns are still random, but you'll get a full container of parts and ammo for a single gun with this change.

## Supported Mods
### Ladders?!
Many maps have been reworked to add optional support for the [Ladders!?](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2737665235) mod. These will offer alternate exits to many maps. If the map supports it and the mod is enabled, the extra bits for where the ladders go will all be taken care of automatically. If the mod isn't enabled everything should still work normally. At the current time there is a bug for west facing ladders that have a wall to the north of them. This shouldn't impact any of the maps here and hopefully that bug will be fixed in the future.
### Functional Appliances 2
[Functional Appliances 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042138819)
Soda machines can be plumbed into safehouses that don't have them, some safehouses have popcorn machines or beer taps that the mod will make usable.
### Gun's Elevator mod
* [Gun's Elevator mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3411580812)
Some safehouses have elevators, one in particular really isn't a great location without it unless you really like stairs! All the safehouses with elevators should work if you have this mod enabled and the safehouse is powered. Safehouses with elevators are all designed with access points other than the elevators if you are not using this mod.

| The drug trade is a rough life and it shows. This run down property features the leftovers of the drug trade, but shows great potential for the dedicated survivor looking to really put some ownership into how things look. Featuring a solid workroom and many leftovers, this fixer upper isn't far from Muldraugh proper, but far enough to feel like you're away from it all. | ![Muldraugh Drug Shack](readme/35_basement.jpg) |
| ***Pros***: Blank slate for fixing up however you like | ***Cons***: Very messy and lots of work to make comfortable |
